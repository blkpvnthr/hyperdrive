# Don't actually need to save the radius => just need to use it to modify points that plot will use ultimately
# Need to save final data plot will use after deciding shapes and processing


# and then get 2d and 3d correct from visualize_plotly.ipynb
# make 2d square?
# use contour for 2d?
# have options for rect prism, cube, sphere, icosphere, or octahedron as param for 3d
# have option for go.Volume / Isosurface vs small points (from notebook) - may be js
# have param for refinement / num of points in linspace
